# Deleted-Multiliveries (not to be confused with Geofs-Multiliveries)
Hi there!
This is an addon which is almost identical to Multiliveries otherwise known as Geofs-Multiliveries, ML or Geo-ML.
The only difference is that this uses the "rejected liveries" or liveries which have not passed voting and therefore have not been added.
# How can we submit liveries?
Well... it's kinda complicated
First, you need to make a fictional livery, personal livery, "out of model" livery etc... for Multiliveries
Then, it needs to be put into voting which can take several hours to many weeks if you're unlucky.
Now it needs to be rejected, otherwise it will be put into the ML livery which can be found here:https://github.com/Spice9/Geofs-Multiliveries.
To submit liveries to ml, join ML's discord here: https://discord.gg/KSgp5YQ622 (This is already on the ML github page but do not use the issues page to submit liveries). We have also added extra addons like LiverySelector.
Also please "DO NOT USE THE ISSUES PAGE FOR SUBMITING LIVERIES", you might be familiar with that quote from Multiliveries, me and Luke have discussed that we don't want our issues page to be filled with liveries as it may make it hard to find actual issues, if you do submit with issues, it will be simply ignored or even closed
# Regarding broken liveries...
Please note that this is a common thing and can be found in other addons such as ML, LiverySelector etc...
Please inform us by using an issue and luke will hopefully fix it soon...
# Please note
Liveries may not be added if they're for a contributer who did not ask for their liveries to be in other addons so we need to get your permission first
# Thank you for using our addon
Best Regards,
Collaborators of Deleted-Multiliveries
